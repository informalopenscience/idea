 * Branches are ordered `master`, `develop`, then topic branches alphabetically

Science, done informally and professionally.

## Goal

To do science informally and professionally.

 * Informally: work comes first, no money
 * Professionally: the best Open Science practices

## Researching via Discord

We do our science, while chatting on Discord.
To join, send Richel a Discord Friend Request: `richelbilderbeek#9002`.
He'll add you to the informalopenscience server.

## Meetings

 * Date: Weekly, every ?Friday
 * Time: ?17:00-19:00
 * On Discord

We follow this timetable:

What             | Time

Work starts      | 17:15
Break time!      | 18:00
Work continues   | 18:15
End of lesson    | 19:00

## Code of Conduct

See [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

In case it is undesirable to email Richel,
contact [need to find other one].

## FAQ

### Science

#### How do we pick which project?

By voting.

The exact procedure:

 * Each team member can suggest any number of projects.
 * Each project is presented in 5 minutes max.
 * Each team member can vote on each project he/she would enjoy to do.
 * The project with the most votes wins. 
   In case of a draw, there are voting rounds between the winners, 
   until there is a winner.

#### What is meant with Open Science?

Open Science is a diffuse concept.
We follow these rules:

 * Open communication: communication via GitHub Issues
 * Open workflow: git keeps a history of our work, both for the paper,
   as well as the experiment
 * Open attribution: git shows that all authors contributed substantially
 * No HARKing: we publish our article, with Introduction and Methods
   before we do the actual experiment

#### Where is the paper pre-registered?

The only known candidate for now is [https://osf.io](https://osf.io).

The team will vote where the paper is pre-registered.

#### What is the intended journal?

A platinum journal, in which one can publish open access articles for free.

The team will vote which journal.

 * Because the team is informal, there can be no money involved.
 * Because the team does open science, the article must be open access.

### Work

#### What is meant with informal?

 * Work goes first: you are always excused to be absent
 * Having a beer is fine

#### How can I contribute?

You can help write the paper or the code or both. 

#### I am a newbie researcher. What must I do?

Welcome to the team! Here is a more-or-less-chronological (i.e. if you
get stuck, start working on the next one) list of what to do:

 * Become an IOS team member
 * Modify README.md on master branch
 * Make a branch for yourself via the GitHub web interface
 * Modify README.md on your local harddrive on your own branch
 * Add your branch's badges to the README.md

When you feel comfortable with the workflow, you become a junior researcher!

#### I am a junior researcher, what should I do?

Junior researcher are comfortable with the workflow,
especially git and GitHub. 

If you want to write the paper:

 * Write :-)

If you want to work on the code:

 * Do Issues labeled 'good first Issue' or 'junior'

Golden rules:

 * Whatever you work on, always be assigned to an Issue
 * Whatever code you develop, always be working to fix a test,
   unless you work on graphics
 * If all tests pass, we are -by definition- happy

#### I am a medior researcher, what should I do?

A medior developer 

 * writes tests and creates Issues for juniors and themselves
 * does code reviews
 * works on more complex issues, such as improving the architecture of
   the code or improving the continuous integration tools (whatever those are :-))
 * see the bigger picture of the code and the team.

You know what to do :+1:
