 * Branches are ordered `master`, `develop`, then topic branches alphabetically

Science, done informally and professionally.

## Goal

To do science informally and professionally.

 * Informally: work comes first
 * Professionally: the best Open Science practices

## Researching via Discord

We do our science, while chatting on Discord.
To join, send Richel a Discord Friend Request: `richelbilderbeek#9002`.
He'll add you to the informalopenscience server.

## Meetings

 * Date: Weekly, every ?Friday

## I am a newbie researcher. What must I do?

Welcome to the team! Here is a more-or-less-chronological (i.e. if you
get stuck, start working on the next one) list of what to do:

 * Become an IOS team member
 * Modify README.md on master branch
 * Make a branch for yourself via the GitHub web interface
 * Modify README.md on your local harddrive on your own branch
 * Add your branch's badges to the README.md

When you feel comfortable with the workflow, you become a junior researcher!

## I am a junior researcher, what should I do?

Junior researcher are comfortable with the workflow,
especially git and GitHub. 

If you want to write the paper:

 * Write :-)

If you want to work on the code:

 * Do Issues labeled 'good first Issue' or 'junior'

Golden rules:

 * Whatever you work on, always be assigned to an Issue
 * Whatever code you develop, always be working to fix a test,
   unless you work on graphics
 * If all tests pass, we are -by definition- happy

## I am a medior researcher, what should I do?

A medior developer 

 * writes tests and creates Issues for juniors and themselves
 * does code reviews
 * works on more complex issues, such as improving the architecture of
   the code or improving the continuous integration tools (whatever those are :-))
 * see the bigger picture of the code and the team.

You know what to do :+1:
